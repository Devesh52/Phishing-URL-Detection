# Phishing-URL-Detection

A web application for detecting phishing URLs using a deep learning model and BERT tokenizer. Built as a course project for Information Assurance and Security (IT352) at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal by Devesh Satpathy and Balaji Anirudh.

## Project Overview
This project provides a web interface to detect whether a given URL is benign or phishing. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and BERT tokenizer for feature extraction and classification. The application is built using Flask and provides real-time predictions.
## Features
- Web-based interface for easy URL input and result display.
- BERT tokenizer for advanced URL feature extraction.
- Deep learning model (CNN) for phishing detection.
- Predictions are saved to a file.
